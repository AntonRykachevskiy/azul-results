This is the small example of full usage. 

Preciece explanation of each script usage can be found in /azul-fin base directory in README_* files.

1) run ./process_data.sh to produce .rd files from .hdrh
2) run ./run_comparer.sh with two input arguments which are names of VM you want to compare. 
In this example this should be Dev, Highlander or Oracle. 
$~: ./run_comparer.sh Dev Oracle
This script will produce all output to log.out file, also plots will be saved as picture and interactive plot will be shown in external window.
3) run ./run_plotter.sh with any number of arguments from list: Dev, Highlander or Oracle. This will plot the results and save picture to file.
